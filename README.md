## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han ORIGINAL CODE
CONAN DUONG EDITED for emotion

---

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

Emotion Fustration was added. It is conveyed through the blob’s movement and environmental design rather than through visual changes alone. Slight inconsistencies in acceleration and jump strength reduce the player’s sense of control, making movement feel unreliable. Increased gravity and slippery platforms further undermine stability, resulting in frequent near-success failures. Although the environment initially appears navigable, it subtly resists the player’s actions, mirroring the emotional experience of frustration and reinforcing a sense of persistent resistance.

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.

Gen AI used to help give ideas for what to change or add for emotion and to ask for code inputs we have not leanrd to I can practice using them and get familiar with differnt inputs an dhow to use them.
